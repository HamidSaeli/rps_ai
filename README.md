# Rock Paper Scissors AI Game

## 📌 Overview
This project is an AI-powered **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game that utilizes **LSTM neural networks** to predict the player's next move and adapt to their playstyle. It includes voice recognition, emotion detection, and a graphical user interface.

## 🚀 Features
- 🎮 **Interactive GUI** built with Tkinter.
- 🧠 **AI-powered predictions** using LSTM neural networks.
- 🎤 **Voice recognition** for hands-free gameplay.
- 📷 **Emotion detection** via webcam.
- 📊 **Player statistics** with data visualization.
- 🔊 **Sound effects** for a more immersive experience.

## 🏗️ Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **TensorFlow & Keras** 🧠
- **OpenCV** 🎥
- **SpeechRecognition** 🎙️
- **Pyttsx3 (Text-to-Speech)** 🔊
- **Pygame** 🎵
- **Matplotlib** 📊
- **Tkinter** 🖥️

## 🎯 How It Works
1. The player selects their move via **GUI** or **voice command**.
2. The AI predicts the player's next move using past patterns and **LSTM networks**.
3. The AI plays its move strategically to maximize its chances of winning.
4. The game tracks statistics and displays insights on the player's behavior.
5. The player can visualize their playstyle through graphs.

## 🛠️ Installation
### 1️⃣ Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Python 3.8+** installed. Then, install dependencies:
```sh
pip install numpy opencv-python tensorflow speechrecognition pyttsx3 pygame matplotlib colorama tqdm
```

### 2️⃣ Run the Game
Execute the following command to start the game:
```sh
python main.py
```

## 🎤 Voice Commands
- Say **"Rock"**, **"Paper"**, or **"Scissors"** to make a move.
- If unrecognized, the system will prompt for another input.

## 📊 Playstyle Insights
- The game **analyzes** your moves over time.
- A bar graph displays which move you favor the most.
- Use this insight to **break patterns** and trick the AI!

## 🔧 Future Improvements
- 🤖 **More advanced AI** for better predictions.
- 🎭 **Emotion-based AI reactions**.
- 🌐 **Web-based version** using Flask or Streamlit.
